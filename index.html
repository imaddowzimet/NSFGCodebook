Online codebook for National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)

<div class="description">
This webpage can be used to look at key variable information for all variables in the male and female respondent files from the NSFG for Cycle 6 (2002), as well as the 2006-10, 2011-13, 2013-15, 2015-17, 2017-19 continuous interview waves. Use the search box to search using the variable name, question or description, and then click a specific variable for detailed information for all waves for which it is available. Information in this codebook originally comes from the NSFG's online documentation ("Webdoc"), and this site is not affiliated with the NSFG; hopefully, however, it will be useful to NSFG users using data pooled across waves or survey types.
