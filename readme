The files on this page are used to create an online codebook for the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), available at https://imaddowzimet.github.io/NSFGCodebook/

The webpage can be used to look at key variable information for all variables in the male and female respondent files from the NSFG for Cycle 6 (2002), as well as the 2006-10, 2011-13, 2013-15, 2015-17, 2017-19 continuous interview waves. Information in this codebook originally comes from the NSFG's online documentation ("Webdoc"), which is no longer available online. Please note that this site is not affiliated with the NSFG, and is meant as a helpful reference tool;  users should consult official documentation at <a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm

In the Programs and Data folder, I've stored the raw HTML codebooks, as well as the complete set of  programs used to scrape the data, turn it into a unified dataset of metadata, and create the website linked above. THe webpage is in beta, and I welcome suggestions; NSFG users should also feel free to use the dataset in "Programs and Data/Data" for their own use (or to create alternate sites!).  One project in progress using this dataset: an R and Stata package that will help users check for consistencies in value labels across waves.
